                        KeyValue MediaWiki extension

KeyValue is an extension that allows you to store one or more key/values on a 
mediawiki page by using the keyvalue function. The extension is also focussed 
on keeping it simple, and tries to cover a minimal set of functionality.

The values are not typed and stored as text in a table in the database. A 
value is stored for a certain key and a certain category.

You can access all categories through a special page, and all key/values for a 
specific category through a subpage of that special page. You can also download 
the key/values for a specific category as a csv file.
